Changes Documentation
1. App.jsx
Wrapped the application in PaymentReceiptContext and ShowReceiptContext providers for global state access to payment receipt data and modal visibility.

2. DashboardLayout.jsx
Updated to consume values from the new contexts to support features such as displaying the receipt modal.

3. OverviewChartsTabs.jsx
Renamed from Tabs.jsx to OverviewChartsTabs.jsx for clarity.

Updated structure to organize and display overview charts more effectively.

4. PaymentLists.jsx
Refactored to retrieve payment data and trigger the receipt modal via context instead of prop drilling.

5. PaymentsTable.jsx
Adjusted table classes for a more compact layout (text-xs/10 min-w-full table-auto mb-1).

Integrated PaymentReceiptContext and ShowReceiptContext so clicking a description sets the active receipt and opens the modal.

Updated to use context for payment data and modal actions.

7. ReceiptModal.jsx
Connected to PaymentReceiptContext and ShowReceiptContext to display transaction details and control modal visibility.

Adjusted the padding

9. PaymentReceiptContext.jsx
Introduced PaymentReceiptContext and ShowReceiptContext with provider components and hooks for managing active receipt data and modal visibility.

10. OverviewPage.jsx
Updated the imports since I changed the file name form Tabs to OverviewChartsTabs

11. PaymentProcessingPage.jsx
Updated to use the new context for improved interaction with the payment receipt modal.
